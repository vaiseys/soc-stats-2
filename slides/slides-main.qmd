# Theoretical background

## Asking causal questions

-   Does more education *cause* higher wages?
-   Does participating in a job training program *cause* a higher
    probability of employment?
-   Do boycotts *cause* a drop in a company's share price?
-   These are tough questions!

## Threats to causal inference

```{r confounding, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "confounding.JPG"))

```

## Key term: Identification

How do we *identify* the effect of a treatment (cause) on an outcome?

## Experimental independent variables

-   What is an experiment?
-   How do experiments solve the problem we just talked about?

## Experiments are great!

Assuming successful randomization to treatment and control, you **know**
it's the treatment that's causing the effect.

## Experiments can't do everything

-   ethics
-   external validity
-   often non-representative
-   some treatments are hard or impossible to assign randomly
    -   motherhood
    -   divorce
    -   boycotts

## Why experiments work

## Some notation

$T$ a binary treatment variable

$Y$ the value of the outcome we observe

$Y^0$ the value the outcome *would* take if $T=0$

$Y^1$ the value the outcome *would* take if $T=1$

*Let's think about the last two a bit more carefully...*

## The world before the experiment

```{r}
d_before <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(2,3,3,2) ,
  Y1 = c(3,4,4,3) ,
  T = as.numeric(NA_integer_),
  Y = as.numeric(NA_integer_) )
d_before |> kable()
```

What do these numbers mean?

## The world after the experiment

```{r}
d_after <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(NA,3,NA,2) ,
  Y1 = c(3,NA,4,NA) ,
  T = c(1,0,1,0),
  Y = c(3,3,4,2) )
d_after |> kable()
```

$$ Y = TY^1+(1-T)Y^0 $$

## Potential outcomes and counterfactuals

-   $Y = Y^1$ for $T = 1$
-   $Y = Y^0$ for $T = 0$
-   We *can't know* $Y^1$ for those who are $T=0$
-   We *can't know* $Y^0$ for those who are $T=1$
-   This is the **fundamental problem of causal inference.**

## Potential outcomes and counterfactuals

-   $Y^0$ and $Y^1$ are *potential outcomes*.
-   In the real world, $T$ is either 1 or 0 for each case.
-   We see $Y^1$ or $Y^0$, but never both.
-   When $T=0$, $Y^1$ is *counterfactual*
-   When $T=1$, $Y^0$ is *counterfactual*

## What do we want to know?

We really care about the difference between $Y^0$ and $Y^1$. (Why?)

Let $\delta_i = y^1_i - y^0_i$

$E[\delta]=E[Y^1-Y^0]$

$E[\delta]=E[Y^1]-E[Y^0]$

This is the definition of a **treatment effect**.

## Assume an experiment: what is $E[\delta]$?

```{r}
d_before |> kable()
```

If we could see this (invisible) world, what would be our calculation of
the treatment effect?

**Why can't we make these calculations in real life?**

## Assume an experiment: what is $E[\delta]$?

```{r}
d_after |> kable()
```

**Does this give us the right answer? Why?**

## Why do experiments work?

$T \bot Y^0$

$T \bot Y^1$

$E[Y^0 | T = 0] = E[Y^0 | T = 1 ]$

$E[Y^1 | T = 0] = E[Y^1 | T = 1 ]$

## Or in other words...

In a properly executed experiment, there is no association between the
potential outcome variables and treatment assignment.

$E[Y^0 | T = 0] \simeq E[Y^0]$

$E[Y^1 | T = 1] \simeq E[Y^1]$

So...

$E[\delta] = E[Y|T=1]-E[Y|T=0]$

The difference between the treatment average and the control average

## What is this treatment effect?

$E[\delta]$ is the expected value (mean) of the difference between each
unit's value of $Y^1$ and $Y^0$. It is the **average treatment effect
(ATE).** In a sample, this is the **sample average treatment effect
(SATE).**

Even though the individual differences are unobservable (because either
$Y^0$ or $Y^1$ will be counterfactual for each unit), we can estimate
the mean difference via experiment.

$$\text{SATE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y^1_i - y^0_i)$$

## Randomization

-   Experiments identify the SATE because cases are randomly assigned to
    the treatment and control group and are, therefore, identical *on
    average*, on all pre-treatment characteristics.
-   Experiments are sometimes called **randomized controlled trials**
    (or RCTs)

## Bias in observational data

1.  Treated and control cases might be different from each other even in
    the same treatment state (**baseline bias**)
2.  Treated and control cases might respond differently to treatment
    (**treatment effect heterogeneity**)

```{r confounding2, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images", "confounding.JPG"))
```

## Key term: baseline bias

```{r}
d_college1 <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(4000,2000,3000,3000) ,
  Y1 = c(4000,2000,3000,3000) ,
  T = NA_integer_,
  Y = NA_integer_ )
d_college1 |> kable()

```

## Baseline bias

```{r}
d_college2 <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(NA,2000,NA,3000) ,
  Y1 = c(4000,NA,3000,NA) ,
  T = c(1,0,1,0),
  Y = c(4000,2000,3000,3000) )
d_college2 |> kable()

```

Here, the people who go to college have different *baseline* earnings
that have nothing to do with going to college.

## The "naive estimator"

```{r}
d_college2 |> kable()

```

$$\hat{\delta}_{naive} = E[Y | T = 1] - E[Y | T = 0]$$

$$\hat{\delta}_{naive} = 3500 - 2500 = 1000$$

Is this a good estimate of the SATE? Why or why not?

## Key term: treatment heterogeneity

The treatment may not have a single effect, but may have different
effects for different groups in the population. If the treatment and
control groups (would) respond differently to treatment, this can bias
the estimate of the effect.

## Example 1

```{r}
d_college3 <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(2000,2000,2000,2000) ,
  Y1 = c(4000,2000,4000,2000) ,
  T = NA_integer_,
  Y = NA_integer_ )
d_college3 |> kable()

```

What is the effect of a college degree here?

## Example 1

```{r}
d_college3obs <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(NA,2000,NA,2000) ,
  Y1 = c(4000,NA,4000,NA) ,
  T = c(1,0,1,0),
  Y = c(4000,2000,4000,2000) )
d_college3obs |> kable()
```

How might we calculate the effect of a college degree here?

Does this give the right answer? Why or why not?

## Example 2

```{r}
d_college4 <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(3000,2000,3000,2000) ,
  Y1 = c(4000,3500,4000,3500) ,
  T = NA_integer_,
  Y = NA_integer_ )
d_college4 |> kable()

```

What is the effect of a college degree here?

## Example 2

```{r}
d_college4obs <- tibble(
  Subject = c("Andrew", "Barb", "Catherine", "David") ,
  Y0 = c(NA,2000,NA,2000) ,
  Y1 = c(4000,NA,4000,NA) ,
  T = c(1,0,1,0),
  Y = c(4000,2000,4000,2000) )
d_college4obs |> kable(align = "lcccc")

```

How might we calculate the effect of a college degree on earnings here?

Does this give the right answer? Why or why not?

## Three basic types of treatment effects

- Average treatment effect (**ATE**)
- Average treatment effect on the treated (**ATT** or ATET)
- Average treatment effect on the controls (or untreated) (**ATC** or
    ATU)

::: aside

Sometimes you will see these prefixed with P for "population" (e.g.,
PATT = population ATT) or S for "sample" (e.g., SATT = sample ATT).
Sample estimates are interpreted conditional on the sample data.

:::

## What is the difference?

- **ATE** is $E(Y^1 - Y^0)$ for *all* units (effect of *switching*)

- **ATT** is $E(Y^1 - Y^0)$ for *treated* units (effect of *taking
    away* treatment)

- **ATC** is $E(Y^1 - Y^0)$ for *untreated* units (effect of *adding*
    treatment)

## Exercise: calculating treatment effects

| Group          | $E(Y^1)$ | $E(Y^0)$ |
|:---------------|:--------:|:--------:|
| College degree | **1000** |  *600*   |
| No degree      |  *800*   | **500**  |

If 30% of the population has a degree... 

- What is the naive estimate? 
- What are the ATE, ATT, and ATC?

::: notes
Let's say these are weekly earnings and that we somehow have access to
this counterfactual information

## Regression vs. matching/weighting

**Regression** attempts to identify $T \rightarrow Y$ by adjusting for
$X$ while regressing $Y$ on $T$

**Matching and weighting** attempt to identify $T \rightarrow Y$ by
ensuring that $S$ has the same distribution for all values of $T$

These techniques only allow us to account for *observed* differences
between treated and control cases. If $V$ is unobserved, we can't close
the backdoor path with either of these approaches.

# Exact Matching


## The logic of exact matching

:::{.incremental}

- We want to compare "apples to apples"
- In an experiment, we compare groups who differ only in treatment 
status
- We want to simulate that by comparing groups that are similar in all 
(known) respects except the treatment

:::


## Simulation

  U = rbinom(obs, 1, .5) ,                          # unobserved difference
  S = rbinom(obs, 1, .25 + .5*U) ,                  # U -> S

## Naive estimate

  group_by(S, T) |> 
  summarize(mean_y = mean(Y)) |>

  format_tt(digits = 2)
```

What is the difference within levels of _S_? Does this give us the right answer? Why?


## Review: experimental assumptions

In an experiment, the treatment and control groups are otherwise the same.

**Assumption 1:** $E(Y^1|T=1) = E(Y^1|T=0)$

**Assumption 2:** $E(Y^0|T=1) = E(Y^0|T=0)$

## Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA)

There exist some observable variables, $S$, which *completely account* for the differences between the treatment and control groups.

**Assumption 1-S:** $E(Y^1|T=1,S) = E(Y^1|T=0,S)$

**Assumption 2-S:** $E(Y^0|T=1,S) = E(Y^0|T=0,S)$

. . .

::: aside
**Making this assumption, we can assume that, conditional on *S*, we can (in essence) observe the counterfactual**
:::

## Exact matching

:::{.incremental}

- If we match cases exactly on all observed characteristics, the treatment is
necessarily independent of all those characteristics within groups.
- Unfortunately, there is no way to test the conditional independence assumption
with the potential outcome variables because we can’t observe both $Y^0$ and 
$Y^1$. There might always be something else out there that opens a backdoor 
path.

:::

## What should I use for *S* variables?

- We think so much about omitted variable bias that we don’t often consider the 
risk of overcontrolling
- Using any approach, there is a risk of removing some of the true effect of 
$T$ by controlling for (or conditioning on) post-treatment variables

## Don't condition on post-treatment variables

::: {.column width="40%"}

If we control for A and B here, we're not unconfounding the relationship
between T and Y. Rather, we're controlling away part of the true effect of T!
This is why we shouldn't control for (or stratify on) post-treatment variables.

:::

::::

## Three assumptions

:::{.incremental}

1. Selection on observables (CIA)
2. Overlap (any individual case has a non-zero probability of treatment)
3. Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA; among other things, that the
treatment status and effect of treatment is independent for each case)

# TE heterogeneity

```{r}
th_ex <- tibble(
  SES = c(1L,1L,2L,2L,3L,3L) ,
  n = c(150L,50L,100L,100L,50L,150L) ,
  degree = c(0L,1L,0L,1L,0L,1L) ,
  earnings = c(2000,4000,6000,8000,10000,14000)
)
th_ex %>% 
  tt()

```

What are the ATE and ATT?

. . .

**SATE** = $2667

**SATT** = $3000

## Recap of procedure

1. Take the differences between treated and untreated groups within each 
stratum of $S$
2. Weight these differences by the right distribution for the estimand of 
interest:
  - For the ATT, weight differences by the distribution of $S$ for treated 
  cases
  - For the ATE, weight the differences by the total sample distribution of $S$

## What about this?

```{r}
th_ex2 <- tibble(
  SES = c(1L,1L,2L,2L,3L,3L) ,
  n = c(150L,0L,100L,100L,50L,150L) ,
  degree = c(0L,1L,0L,1L,0L,1L) ,
  earnings = c(2000,NA,6000,8000,10000,14000)
)
th_ex2 %>% 
  tt()

```

What is the ATE here? ATT?

## Why ATT is the most common estimand

:::{.incremental}

1. As the last example illustrates, sometimes we can only estimate one 
treatment effect of interest (if that!). 
2. Since treated cases are usually less frequent than control cases, ATT is 
often easier to get and is the default in many routines.
3. We will often focus on the ATT in the interest of time but the ATE (and 
even ATU) are important in their own right.

:::


## Key term: common support

Strata that have only treatment or control cases (not both) are called 
**off support.** Strata with both treatment and control cases are in the 
**region of common support.**

## Focal example

**What is the effect of maternal smoking on infant health?**

Data are from a subsample (*N* = 4642) of singleton births in PA between 
1989-1991. See Almond et al. 2005. "The Costs of Low Birth Weight."


## Bring in the data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
d <- haven::read_dta(here("data", "cattaneo2.dta"))
d <- d |>  
  haven::zap_labels() |>             # remove Stata labels
  mutate( smoker = factor(mbsmoke, 
                          labels = c("Nonsmoker", "Smoker")) ,
          zweight = (bweight - mean(bweight)) / sd(bweight)) %>%
  select( bweight, zweight, lbweight, mbsmoke, smoker, mmarried, 
          mage, medu, fbaby, alcohol, mrace, nprenatal )

```

::: aside

`zweight` is the standardized birthweight. (Birthweight in grams minus the mean, divided by the standard deviation.) This, as a proxy for health, will be our primary outcome.

:::

## Summary statistics

```{r, echo = TRUE}
d |>  
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  psych::describe(fast = TRUE)

```

## Smoker/non-smoker differences

```{r smoker_boxplot}
ggplot(d, aes( y = bweight , x = smoker )) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = .3) +
  labs(y = "Birthweight (g)" ,
       x = "") +
  theme_light()
```

## T-test of the difference

```{r echo = FALSE}
t.test( zweight ~ smoker , data = d ) |> 
  tidy() |>

```

The t-test gives us the naive estimate of the effect of smoking. If we assume the only difference between smokers and non-smokers is smoking, the effect of smoking is to reduce birthweight by .476 standard deviations (276g).


## Density plot

```{r smoker_density }
ggplot(d, aes( x = bweight , color = smoker, fill = smoker )) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3) +
  labs(x = "Birthweight (grams)") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  theme_light()

```

## Introduction to **MatchIt**

- Implements many different forms of matching
- Many different options to cover (later)
- Basic syntax:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
match_object <- matchit(formula,
                        data = df)

```

## Exact matching by dummy variables

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(MatchIt)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# match on 3 dummy variables only
ematch_out <- 
  matchit(mbsmoke ~ mmarried + alcohol + mrace , 
          data = d,
          method = "exact")

# confirm all are matched
ematch_out
```

Note: later we will define formulas so we don't have to re-type all the variables every time.

## Exact matching by dummy variables

```{r}
# match on 3 dummy variables only
ematch_out <- 
  matchit(mbsmoke ~ mmarried + alcohol + mrace , 
          data = d,
          method = "exact")

# confirm all are matched
ematch_out
summary(ematch_out)[[2]]
```

## Get the matched data

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# get the matched data
ematch_data <- match.data(ematch_out)

# glimpse data
glimpse(ematch_data)

```

## The matched data

```{r}
# get the matched data
ematch_data <- match.data(ematch_out)

# glimpse data
glimpse(ematch_data)

```

## Subclassification

```{r echo = TRUE}
subclass_table <- ematch_data %>% 
  group_by(mmarried, alcohol, mrace) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_t = sum(mbsmoke),                            # Ntreat
    n_c = sum(1-mbsmoke),                          # Ncon
    zbw_t = weighted.mean(zweight, w = mbsmoke),   # mean std bw for treated
    zbw_c = weighted.mean(zweight, w = 1-mbsmoke), # mean std bw for control
    row_diff = zbw_t - zbw_c,                      # mean treat-control diff
    wt_t = weighted.mean( weights, w = mbsmoke),   # mean treat weight
    wt_c = weighted.mean( weights, w = 1-mbsmoke)) # mean control weight
```

## Subclassification table

## Manually calculating ATT/ATE

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# manually calculate ATT
with(subclass_table, 
     sum(n_t*row_diff) / sum(n_t) )

# manually calculate ATE
with(subclass_table, 
     sum((n_t+n_c)*row_diff) / sum(n_t+n_c) )
```


::: aside

You'll never have to do these manual steps. It's just for pedagogical
purposes!

:::

## ATT by weighted least squares (WLS)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
m_att <- lm(zweight ~ mbsmoke , data = ematch_data ,
            weights = weights)
tidy(m_att)

```


::: aside

The weights ensure that the non-smokers' distribution of _S_ is the 
same as the smokers.

## Statistical theory of matching

The jury is still out on the theory behind some of procedures so it's not obvious in many cases what the right way is to calculate standard errors. 

We will cover bootstrapping later which is now (once again) seen as a good option for getting standard errors.

## Lessons from exact matching

### Exact matching contains:

**Matching**: compare treatment/control differences in outcome on cases that 
are identical on other observed characteristics (i.e., matched)

**Weighting**: apply weights so that these stratum-specific differences are 
aggregated in a way that reflects the distribution of interest (e.g., ATT)

## Exact matching isn't often practical

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ematch_out2 <- matchit(mbsmoke ~ mmarried + alcohol + mrace + 
                         fbaby + mage + medu + nprenatal , 
                 data = d,
                 method = "exact")
ematch_out2
summary(ematch_out2)[[2]] # get match summary
```


::: aside

Well over half of treated cases now have no match!

:::

## "Feasible" estimates of TEs

- If we do drop cases because of common support concerns, we signal this by 
calling our estimands "feasible" (i.e., the best we could do!)
- If we drop _any_ cases, we can get FSATE but not SATE
- If we drop _treatment_ cases, we can get FSATT but not SATT

But we don't want a method that requires us to throw away tons of data if we don't have to!


## Moving beyond exact matching

:::{.incremental}

1. Propensity-score based approaches (parametric or semi-parametric)
2. Non-PS-based approaches (non-parametric)
3. Using parametric models (i.e., regression) on a data set preprocessed by (1) or (2)
